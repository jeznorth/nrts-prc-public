			<h2>About this site</h2>
			<p>Section 32(2) of the Land Act sets out the Province’s requirement to publish Crown land applications on a publicly accessibly website. Public participation in the administration of Crown land is encouraged and this site offers a platform for members of the public to submit comments for consideration.</p>
			<p>This site contains Crown land application information posted by the Province as of October 15, 2018. Once an application has been reviewed and a decision made, it will remain on the site for a limited period of time.</p>
			<p class="mb-0">For Crown land application information posted prior to October 15, 2018, please refer to the Applications and Reasons for Decision (ARFD) website (listed below).</p>
